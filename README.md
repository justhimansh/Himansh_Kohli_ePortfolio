## Lessons Learned




Building this project helped me understand the importance of writing clean and reusable
code. Being able to use the same class <div> throughout the project really enabled me 
to build this project as efficiently as possible. This allowed me to add future projects 
by just copying a few lines of code rather than writing distinctive code.
